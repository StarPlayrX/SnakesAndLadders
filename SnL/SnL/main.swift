/// Snakes and Ladders
/// By Todd Bruss (c) 2019

/// v0.0.1 updated stats to show total ladders and snakes landed on by each player
/// v0.0.2 Added Names
/// v0.0.3 Add play-by-play game output

/// Takeaways: the player who reaches the most ladders and least amount of snakes usually wins.
/// The game loop displays a very accurate game simulation. The winner must finish the game with a perfect roll.
/// Oddity, when this code is run in Playgrounds, its turn_counter is not accurate. When run in Xcode or command line, it displays currently
/// This code should runs on Mac as well as Linux. Requirements Swift 5
